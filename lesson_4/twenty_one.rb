Both the player and the Dealer will begin with two cards.
The player will see both of their cards and will see one of the dealer's.
The player will be able to request cards until either they call 'stay' or they
'bust' by going above 21 points.
If the player calls 'stay', the dealer will have an opportunity to try to beat
the player's ending total.
The dealer must have at least 17 points before they can call 'stay'.
